Technologies: Python, Bash, ping, traceroute, nslookup

Key Learning: Automating network troubleshooting and improving network diagnostics efficiency.

2. Service Desk Ticketing System Simulation
Description: A simple ticketing system built to simulate the incident management process of an IT service desk. It includes features like creating and managing tickets, assigning priorities, and tracking resolution status.

Technologies: Python (Flask/Django), SQL databases

Key Learning: Gained experience in service management workflows, ITIL processes, and service desk operations.

3. Cloud Infrastructure Automation
Description: A set of scripts that automate the process of setting up cloud infrastructure on AWS and Azure, including provisioning virtual machines, configuring security groups, and setting up basic environments.

Technologies: Python, AWS SDK, Azure CLI, Terraform

Key Learning: Practical skills in cloud platforms and infrastructure automation using Terraform and cloud SDKs.

4. Windows/MacOS Automated Deployment System
Description: A script/tool to automate the deployment of software packages and configuration settings across multiple Windows and MacOS devices in a network. Ideal for large-scale IT deployments in organizations.

Technologies: PowerShell (Windows), Bash (MacOS), SCCM, JAMF, Intune

Key Learning: Experience in OS deployment automation, patch management, and software distribution in corporate environments.

5. Network Security Tools
Description: A set of simple network security tools that help detect open ports, check for vulnerable protocols, and simulate firewall rule validation. These tools are designed to assist in identifying potential security risks in a network.

Technologies: Python, Nmap, Wireshark

Key Learning: Improved understanding of network security, firewall management, and vulnerability detection.

6. Incident Management Dashboard
Description: A real-time dashboard for tracking and managing IT incidents. This project features an intuitive web interface for incident creation, status tracking, and resolution. It also integrates basic analytics and SLA monitoring.

Technologies: React.js, Flask/Django, SQL/NoSQL databases, ServiceNow API (optional)

Key Learning: Gained experience in creating custom incident management tools and integrating APIs for monitoring and reporting.

7. OS Migration Automation Tool
Description: A tool that automates the migration process for upgrading from one OS version to another (for example, from Windows 7 to Windows 10). The project uses automation scripts to streamline the process across multiple devices.

Technologies: PowerShell, Bash, SCCM, Intune

Key Learning: Hands-on experience with large-scale OS migrations and deployment strategies.

8. Virtualized Environment Lab (for Learning & Troubleshooting)
Description: A virtualized lab setup that allows for testing and troubleshooting various networking and system issues. The lab consists of multiple virtual machines running different OSes (Windows, Linux) and networking configurations.

Technologies: VirtualBox, VMware, Windows, Linux, Networking tools (ping, traceroute, Wireshark)

Key Learning: Experience in configuring and troubleshooting complex virtualized network environments, a key skill for diagnosing network problems in a controlled environment.
